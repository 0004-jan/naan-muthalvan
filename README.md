# naan-muthalvan

This project, developed using Salesforce Developer Edition, aims to reduce food wastage by connecting food donors, NGOs, and volunteers through a single cloud-based platform. It automates the process of collecting and delivering leftover food to the needy using Salesforce tools like Flow Builder, Apex Triggers, and Lightning Web Components (LWC). The system ensures transparency, real-time tracking, and efficient coordination, helping achieve the goal of zero hunger and promoting sustainable community welfare.
